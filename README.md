```

This will download and install the latest version of the package from the master branch.

## Important Functions

The following are some of the key functions provided by the AdaptGMCP package:

- `simMAMSMEP`: Runs simulations for adaptive group sequential multiple testing procedures.
- `adaptGMCP_CER`: Performs analysis using the CER (Conditional Error Rate) method.
- `adaptGMCP_PC`: Performs analysis using the p-value combination method.

For detailed usage and arguments of each function, please refer to the help section in R after installing the package (e.g., `?simMAMSMEP`).
